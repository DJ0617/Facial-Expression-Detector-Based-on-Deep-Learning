# Facial-Expression-Detector-Based-on-Deep-Learning 
Mental health and old-age healthcare have been increasingly serious problems in the world;
However, both problems are hard to detect and pose a great challenge to the government. Some
research has shown that facial expression is an effective way to keep track of an individualâ€™s
health. We built and trained a model pipeline using deep learning methods that can detect face
images in pictures and classify various facial expressions. The model was trained on the
AffectNet dataset [1] and achieved an accuracy of 50%.
